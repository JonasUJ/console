thcm# console
A tool thats shitty and buggy, but i'll still create it.

command syntax = CMD ARG1 "ARG 2" "ARG \"3\""

type "help" for a list of commands

embed commands in commands by enclosing the command in ~'s (tildas) like this: cmd "~cmd arg~"
the command will then run, if it returns anything it gets put in ~cmd arg~'s place
e.g 'say "~cal 1+1~"' will become 'say 2' which will print 2
